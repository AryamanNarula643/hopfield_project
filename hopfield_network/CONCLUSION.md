# Project Conclusion: Hopfield Network Implementation

## Completed Requirements

The project has successfully implemented all required components:

1. ✅ **Dataset Preparation**:
   - Created and stored 25 unique 16x16 pixel black and white images in PBM format
   - Developed utilities for reading, writing, and manipulating PBM files

2. ✅ **Hopfield Network Implementation**:
   - Implemented the Hebbian learning rule for training
   - Created functions for pattern energy calculation
   - Added pattern similarity measurement for evaluation

3. ✅ **Memory Corruption Methods**:
   - Pixel flipping with configurable probability
   - Cropping (removing portions of patterns)

4. ✅ **Update Rules**:
   - Synchronous updates (all neurons at once)
   - Asynchronous updates (one neuron at a time)
   - Convergence detection for both methods

5. ✅ **Testing with Corrupted Patterns**:
   - Tested recall with both flipped pixels and cropped patterns
   - Compared performance of sync and async updates

6. ✅ **Performance Analysis**:
   - Analyzed network behavior across different noise levels (10%-80%)
   - Tracked convergence rates and iterations required

7. ✅ **Visualization**:
   - Created visualizations of original patterns
   - Generated visualizations of corrupted and recalled patterns
   - Produced graphs showing performance vs corruption level
