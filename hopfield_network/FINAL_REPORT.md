# Hopfield Network Project - Final Report

## Project Overview

This project implemented a Hopfield Network for storing and recalling 16x16 pixel black and white images. The network successfully demonstrates the fundamental properties of associative memory systems, including pattern storage, noise tolerance, and pattern completion capabilities.

## Key Implementation Details

1. **Hebbian Learning Rule**: Successfully implemented to train the network to store multiple patterns.

2. **Update Rules**: Both synchronous and asynchronous update methods were implemented and compared.

3. **Energy Function**: Properly implemented to ensure the network converges to stable states.

4. **Pattern Corruption**: Two methods were implemented:
   - Pixel flipping with variable probability
   - Partial occlusion through cropping

5. **Pattern Similarity**: Cosine similarity measures were used to evaluate recall quality.

## Experimental Results

### Pattern Recall

The network demonstrated excellent recall capabilities for patterns corrupted with random noise:

- At 10-20% corruption: Perfect recall in most cases
- At 30% corruption: Very high similarity to original patterns
- At 40% corruption: Moderate recall success
- At 50% corruption: Transition point between recall and failure
- Beyond 60% corruption: Consistent recall of inverted patterns

These results align with theoretical expectations for Hopfield Networks, where the basins of attraction around stored patterns allow for noise tolerance up to a certain threshold.

### Pattern Completion

The network struggled more with structural damage (cropping) compared to random noise. This is expected behavior in standard Hopfield Networks, which are better suited to handling distributed noise than concentrated structural damage.

### Update Rule Comparison

Both synchronous and asynchronous update methods performed similarly in our experiments. While asynchronous updates are generally considered more stable for larger networks, the relatively small size of our network (256 neurons) meant that both methods worked effectively.

## Future Improvements

1. **Increased Capacity**: Implementing alternative learning rules like the Storkey rule could improve storage capacity.

2. **Pattern Preprocessing**: Adding preprocessing steps could improve robustness to certain types of corruption.

3. **Sparsification**: Implementing sparse coding techniques could increase network capacity and performance.

4. **Temperature Parameter**: Adding simulated annealing could help escape local minima in difficult recall scenarios.

## Conclusion

The Hopfield Network implementation successfully met all project requirements, demonstrating:

1. Storage of multiple 16x16 pixel patterns
2. Successful recall of patterns from corrupted inputs
3. Analysis of performance across different corruption levels
4. Visualization of network behavior

The project illustrates both the strengths (good noise tolerance) and limitations (pattern completion challenges) of Hopfield Networks as associative memory systems.
